                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><strong>Damp Ruins</strong><br>By the Eyellusionist<br>17.11.23</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>The dream began in a dark castle and I was surrounded by crates and other cargo. Sections of the inner castle were separated by water. Across a small wooden bridge was a female blacksmith with a slim build. She had dark grey skin, horns, hooves, and flaming lime green eyes. She wore the kind of aproned clothes that blacksmiths typically wear.<br>
<br>I decided to walk over to the blacksmith and talk to her. She did not say any words, but she presented me with a portal which displayed her “wares”. It were as though I was looking at a menu screen in a videogame. I selected a couple of items, but I do not recall which. Then suddenly, I accidentally selected one of the items which looked more like a place...<br>
<br>The “transaction” seemingly could not be cancelled, unfortunately. And before I knew it, I was transported to the area displayed to me by the blacksmith. The dark castle became replaced by a sunny scenery. There were now stone brick structures all around me resembling pieces of broken castle-like buildings.<br>
<br>The entire area was damp, with the sun projecting a warm glow onto the environment. My vision was also shifted to a third person perspective, and I could see that I wore a long black leather coat. In fact, my shirt and trousers were also comprised of the same black leather and reflected the sunlight. I was standing in couple of centimetres of water.
<br><br>Before I had any time to explore my surroundings, I was spotted by a large light-grey creature. It had two large arms and two small hind legs, and one glowing red eye where its neck should be. It ran up to me as soon as it noticed my presence.<br>
<br>I decided to run from the hostile creature. I ran around several of the stone structures, trying to lose it. To no avail, the creature proceeded to lunge at me. I did my best to dodge away from its attacks. Without a weapon, I wondered how I was going to defeat it.
<br><br>Then suddenly, an idea came to mind, and I attempted to lure the monster inside one of the structures. I hid behind a stone wall of one of the broken buildings and waited for it to enter inside. I then came from behind the monster, jumped over it, and punched in the eye. The monster frantically panicked before exiting the building and running away.
<br>
<br>As I exited the broken building, I was spotted by yet another monster, but this one was much taller and skinnier and able to climb and crawl nimbly along the walls of the stone structures. This monster in particular somehow resembled an Asian school girl with long black hair, wearing a Japanese-inspired uniform.<br>
<br>The monster jumped up and down as it chased after me, creating shockwaves of electricity each time it landed. I had to dodge and roll across the damp wet ground to avoid the attacks, causing my coat and clothes to appear wet and somewhat dirty. One of the shockwaves managed to hit me and knocked me off of my feet, causing me to land onto the muddy wet ground, on my back.<br>
<br>Eventually, the monster took a rest after becoming tired of chasing me. I used this moment to my advantage, and climbed up the tall monster, before attacking its head with a few punches. As I landed on my feet, the monster appeared to transform and become more powerful. It then began to rain.<br>
<br>It turned out that the monster had gained ice attacks and started shooting ice projectiles at me, which I had to dodge. It stomped on the ground, with ice spikes emanating from the area of impact, pointing upwards. I then jumped quickly to avoid the spikes.<br>
<br>After some repeated dodging and fighting, I eventually managed to knock the monster into a metal canister, causing it to become trapped inside. I then kicked the canister over to a large cylindrical sewer drain pipe. I sent the canister flying into the giant pipe, hoping that the monster would not escape from it.<br>
<br>Despite my efforts, the canister still rolled back down the giant sewer pipe, enabling the weakened monster to come loose from being trapped inside the canister. The monster was still in a weakened state, however, allowing me enough time to deal one final blow.<br>
<br>And so, I reached into my inventory and realised I had a weapon resembling a pair of scissors which I hadn’t used. The thought of chopping the monster’s head off using the scissors then crossed my mind. But I hesitated, thinking that it would be far too cruel for me to execute the monster in such a fashion...<br>
<br>But then the monster unexpectedly hissed, “What is the difference between beheading me and receiving my head on a platter?” catching me off guard.<br>
<br>Time was now running out, and the monster had noticed my hesitancy and was planning to attack. With no time to spare, I decided to instead tug on the monster’s head with all of my might, ripping its head off with my bare hands. It was only then that I realised that the monster was actually a doll. And so I managed to tear off its arms with my bare hands also.
<br><br>The monster was somehow not yet dead, but the dream had ended there.&nbsp;<br></p>
